And I want to say thank-you so much Mr. Netflix cause this was so great! At first I thought oh no, this is a formula and it was a lil' formulaic but then quickly I realized something different was transpiring! Case it was funny and witty and cute! And at the end , they used the formula to do something seminal by turning the formula upside down! Way to go, I highly recommend it , and the writers are very cool cause they are from Canada and Degrassi is from Canada and a lot of the writers there are amazing! Great job! Terrific!
Love Hard is amazing! I love Catfish: The show so I assumed I would enjoy this. Surprisingly, I almost loved it! This movie had gorgeous Christmas decorations, a beautiful story, and hilarious jokes. Also, I did not know Nina Dobrev could sing? The singing in the movie was something added I never knew I needed. I don't understand why they used a different voice for Harry Shum Jr. When he was on Glee, but I think it was a joke.
