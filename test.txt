Fit with charging leads and atmosphere- but lacking a fitting narrative- Love Hard is more good than bad- but it also could have been a lot more. For a while now I have been a huge fan of comedian Jimmy O. Yang and i'm so glad he finally got the leading man role he deserves. The guy just radiates charisa, along with his charismatic co-star Nina Dobrev who plays our lead character- both with perfect chemistry along the way. The film is well paced and entertaining all the way through, but the script suffers some major issues throughout and doesn't seem to know what to do with its interesting premise. There are a handful of corny moments, predictable moments, and it follows a pretty standard formula in the end. But overall, its charm and lead actors make the film better than the sum of its parts, and make it worth at the very least a one time watch. In the end, I hope to see both Dobrev and Yang in more films of this type in the future, and i'm optimistic for what the future holds for both of their blossoming careers. Its a romantic film with some subpar moments, and maybe that's all it needs to be.
